  <div class="lead">Dear Parent,</div>
<div class="lead">Your child is attempting to create an account on our privacy protected social platform, Teendit, that helps teenagers expand their social network without exposing themselves to internet work’s risks, such as social fraud, bullying, and digital kidnapping. We won’t transfer your data to any other third party company.
</div>
<div class="lead">Since your child is between 13 to 18 years old, we need your approval to verify the child’s and your guardianship of the child according to Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”). This way, we can assure your child identity and relationship with you in real life, so as to avoid fake and malicious account on the platform. In addition, we would limit the time children use Teendit to prevent social media addiction.</div>
<div class="lead">Please send documents that can prove your child's name, birthdate and your guardianship of the child, such as your ID, or driver licenses. Once we verify your identity, we would delete your file completely on our database and activate your child’s account. Your document would be properly encrypted and if there are any questions, please email back to us, we will reply to you as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="lead">Yours,</div>
