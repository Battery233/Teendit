					<li><strong> WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Personal information you disclose to us</strong></p>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em></p>
					<p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when&nbsp;registering at the&nbsp;Services&nbsp;expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the&nbsp;Services&nbsp;(such as posting messages in our online forums or entering competitions, contests or giveaways)&nbsp;or otherwise contacting us.</p>
					<p>The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the&nbsp;Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:</p>
					<p><strong>Publicly Available Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;We collect&nbsp;your Teendit account ID,&nbsp;email address and user&rsquo; parents&rsquo; email address.</p>
					<p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong>&nbsp;We collect&nbsp;encrypted passwords.</p>
					<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate.</p>
					<ol start="2">
					<li><strong> HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</em></p>
					<p>We use personal information collected via our&nbsp;Services&nbsp;for the purposes described below. We process your personal information for purposes directly related to the functionality of the services on Teendit.

					<li><strong>To enable user-to-user communications.</strong>&nbsp;We may use your information in order to enable user-to-user communications on the post.</li>
					</ul>
					<ol start="3">

					</ol>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this&nbsp;privacy policy&nbsp;unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
					<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this&nbsp;privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than&nbsp;the period of time. However, you cab choose to delete your account or delete any information you posted on Teendit when you want.</p>
					<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
					<ol start="5">
					<li><strong> HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through encryption and technical security measures.</em></p>
					<p>We have implemented appropriate AES <em>encryption </em>and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process including you ID documents and passwords.</p>
					<ol start="6">
					<li><strong> WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.&nbsp;You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
					<p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the&nbsp;<a href="https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/415288/privacy-policy#contact">contact details</a>&nbsp;provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
					<p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>
					<p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

					<ol start="7">
					<li><strong> DATA BREACH</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when&nbsp;Teendit&nbsp;believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that&nbsp;Teendit&nbsp;becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information&nbsp;Teendit&nbsp;will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
					<ol start="8">
					<li><strong> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this&nbsp;privacy policy.</p>
					<ol start="9">
					<li><strong> DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
					<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &ldquo;Shine The Light&rdquo; law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the&nbsp;Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.</p>
					<ol start="10">

The updated version will be indicated by an updated &ldquo;Revised&rdquo; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
